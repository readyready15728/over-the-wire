In this one, `ltrace` can be used to see where the setuid binary `check` uses
`strcmp`:

```bash
leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ltrace ./check
__libc_start_main(0x804853b, 1, 0xffffd784, 0x8048610 <unfinished ...>
printf("password: ")                                                                        = 10
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700password: anything
)                                                       = 97
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700)                                                       = 110
getchar(1, 0, 0x65766f6c, 0x646f6700)                                                       = 121
strcmp("any", "sex")                                                                        = -1
puts("Wrong password, Good Bye ..."Wrong password, Good Bye ...
)                                                        = 29
+++ exited (status 0) +++
```

Thus the juvenile intermediate password is revealed. Using it will drop you
into `/bin/sh`. Using `bash` is recommended as it will allow completion. The
password to the next level can be gotten like so:

```bash
leviathan1@leviathan:~$ ./check
password: sex
$ bash
leviathan2@leviathan:~$ cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2
ougahZi8Ta
```
