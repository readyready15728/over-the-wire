# OverTheWire
## Notes and solutions for the OverTheWire CTF games

I know that OverTheWire doesn't want people to publish solutions but, just as
is the case with [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), that horse has
long since fled the barn. Neither organization wants solutions to be published
but my reaction to both situations is this: if you don't want to "win" in a
way that may preclude any real achievement or learning, then possibly you
don't want to look at my solutions. Take that caveat as you will.

(N.b.: due to the way the wargames are structured, numbers for Markdown files
from 01 onward should be read as corresponding to the levels where the number
*after* the arrow matches the Markdown number.)
