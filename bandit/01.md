Refer to the notes on the previous level. The password is in `readme`. The
username is `bandit1`. The password to the next level is in a file called `-`
accessing this file is tricky. I managed to hack it by going into `python3`
and entering the following:

```python
with open('-') as f:
    print(f.readlines())
```

I later learned that `cat ./-` would have also been effective. The password
for the next level is `CV1DtqXWVFXTvM2F0k09SHz0YwRINYA9`.
