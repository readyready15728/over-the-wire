This next level required the same gimmick as the previous one except that it
was necessary to drop into the shell from Vim. This doesn't work like it
usually should because the login shell in `/etc/passwd` is that useless
`showtext` script. This can be circumvented by entering `:set shell=/bin/bash`
in Vim command mode.

After dropping into the shell, viewing the contents of the home directory
reveals a `setuid` binary, `bandit27-do`. This will carry out whatever command
you like with the permissions of user `bandit27`. `./bandit27-do cat
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit27` reveals the password,
`3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea`.
