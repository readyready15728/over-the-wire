This is the first one where I ran into any real trouble. The page talked about
setting up a daemon but I didn't know how to do that. Well, as it turns out, a
super lightweight way to do that is with netcat, like so: `echo
GbKksEFF4yrVs6il55v6gwY5aVje5f0j | nc -l -p 1024`. (1024 was simply the lowest
port that I could bind due to permissions.) Then I hit `Ctrl-Z` and sent this
with the background with `bg` and did `./suconnect 1024`, which gave me the
password, `gE269g2h3mw3pwgrj0Ha9Uoqen1c9DGr`.
