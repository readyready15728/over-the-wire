This one is a little strange. I have the password but get logged out
automatically because of alteration to `~/.bashrc`. Kind of like the machine
that turns itself off. A little searching revealed that the best way around
this was `ssh -t ssh://bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:2220 bash
--norc`. I'm not entirely sure why `-t` is needed here but it works.
