I had two false leads on this one: the first was trying to log in to port
30000 with SSH. Then I ran `nmap` on `localhost` and wasted a little more time
looking into something called "NDMPS". `nmap` only reports what a port is
typically used for, not what it's actually used for. I noticed `telnet`
mentioned on the page and it really was as simple as `telnet localhost 30000`
then putting in the last password.
