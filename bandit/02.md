The username is `bandit2` and the password is from the previous level.
Noticing a pattern yet? The password to the next level is, ironically, easier
to obtain than in the previous level. It's a file name with spaces in it and
if you use `<Tab>` then the name will autocomplete with the necessary
backslashes. Said password is `UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK`.
