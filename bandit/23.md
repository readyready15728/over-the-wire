This is pretty much the same gimmick as in the previous level but with a
little more obfuscation. Digging around in `/etc/cron.d` leads you to
`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`, which contains the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

The secret here is that `whoami` will output `bandit23` when run by `cron` so
just take the output of `echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1`
and print that file under `/tmp`, yielding the password,
`jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n`.
