This is pretty much the same gimmick as in the previous level but with a
little more obfuscation. Digging around in `/etc/cron.d` leads you to
`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`, which contains the following:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```

To my surprise, this script can in fact be run by the current user. (I had
previously succeeded by defining those two variables by copying and pasting
from the script, ensuring the first was exported to be visible in the second
definition.) The script will out and out tell you which file in `/tmp` to use,
which contains the password, `Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI`.
