For *this one* I definitely needed to look at a walkthrough. Start with the
cryptic comment: "Logging in to `bandit26` from `bandit25` should be fairly
easy...". This turned out to mean that the SSH private key was right in the
home directory and logging in was a simple matter of typing `ssh -i
bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`. So far, so good.

However I was also advised that "[t]he shell for user bandit26 is not
`/bin/bash`, but something else". A quick look at `/etc/passwd` shows that
this is `/usr/bin/showtext`, which turned out to be the following shell
script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

Here's where things get really screwy. It's necessary to make the terminal
window as small as possible so that `more` is forced to page instead of
immediately exiting. This didn't work in `tmux` so I had to open a plain
terminal tab. From there, typing `v` opened up `~/text.txt` in Vim and the
remainder of the task was a simple matter of opening
`/etc/bandit_pass/bandit26` in the editor, revealing the password,
`5czgV9L3Xx8JPOyRbXh6lQbmIOWvPT6Z`.
