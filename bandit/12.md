I'm not going to do a full description of this one because it was kinda
tedious but the long and short of it is that to do `cd $(mktemp -d)`, copy
over `data.txt`, do `xxd -r data.txt > <some file>`, run `file` on whatever it
is you chose, then change the extension to `.tar`, `.gz` or `.bz2` depending
on the output. Keep extracting files and iterating this process until you
finally get a text file. The password is `8ZjyCRiBWFYkneahHwxCv3wb2a1ORpYL`.
