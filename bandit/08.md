There is a quick and easy way to do this: `sort data.txt | uniq -u`. I did
things the hard way: using `mktemp -d`, entering that directory, copying
`data.txt` there (remember: no write access for `$HOME`) and then entering Vim
and typing up and using the following Ruby program:

```ruby
count = Hash.new 0

File.open('data.txt').each_line do |line|
    count[line] += 1
end

puts count.select { |k, v| v == 1 }
```
