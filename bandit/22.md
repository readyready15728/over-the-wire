This one looked far more complicated than it actually is until I saw the file
permissions involved. Examination of `/etc/cron.d` led me here:

```
bandit21@bandit:~$ cat /etc/cron.d/cronjob_bandit22
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```

Following that lead led me to the script named above:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```

Anyone can read that file; it's just obscured a bit. It contains the password,
`Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI`.
